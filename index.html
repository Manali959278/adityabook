            <hr>

            <p class="text-muted text-left">Katherine Paterson's thought-provoking novel "The Same Stuff as Stars" is about families accepting and nurturing each other's differences with love. In other words, family is an integral part towards creating a sense of security and belongingness for any individual.
                <br><br>
                My claim that family is all about accepting and nurturing each other's differences with love stems from Angel taking a decision to raise her brother-Bernie and take care of her grandmother. For example, she took over the responsibility of going to the grocery shop, buying healthy food for a balanced diet and then serving it to all of them. Especially for grandma, who had until then been eating only canned beans and peaches. She became the head of the house, doing her level best to create a sense of security and belongingness. She also took care of Bernie with all the things they had, despite her young age such as dressing him, initiating the love in him to read books, going to school and eating healthy food- ‘the 5 food groups’ instead of just those expensive sugar pops.
                <br><br>
                - You gotta know someone cares about you, or you just give up. - This line said by Angel reveals that even if one person starts caring about you, that person has the power to bind and unite the family and create a balance, even in the hardest circumstances or situations.
                <br><br>

                - Polaris (stress on LAR) is the only star that never changes its place in the sky, at least not so that you can notice it. It has always stay put while the other stars and constellations are moving – from the book – Know the Stars that Angel was reading. -  That was what she needed-a Polaris, a North Star, that never moved. Something steady so that she could always find her way. But what about Bernie? She had been his Polaris, hadn't she? When everything else had changed, at least he had had her. Now, he had Verna who switched around faster than a whirling planet. She wished he knew how to pray. She wanted to pray for Bernie, for Verna and even for Wayne. -  These lines said by Angel tell us that she wanted the family to be united, balanced so as to give a sense of purpose and belonginess.
                <br><br>
                - When I consider thy heavens, the moon and the stars which thou hast ordained, what is man that thou art mindful of him? Thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour. – 8th psalm from Bible. -  This touching quote is said by Miss Liza Irwin (who run the public library) to Angel so as to give her the strength to persevere, reminding us once again of the incredible resilience of childhood and the unquenchable human spirit and family spirit. <br>

                To support my claim, another example is a conversation between Ray Morgan (grandma’s son) and Angel when he was about to die-
                <br><br>
                - You remember what I said last summer? - 
                <br>
                - About what? -
                <br>
                - About us coming from the stars? About our bodies being made of the same stuff as stars? -
                <br>
                - Yeah. -
                <br>
                This explains that 1 person can ignite the will power in oneself and that, that person can even move mountains.
                <br>
                <br>
                - Not even stooping from its sphere,<br>
                It asks a little of us here. <br>
                It asks of us a certain height,<br>
                So, when at times the mob is swayed <br>
                To carry praise or blame too far, <br>
                We may take something like a star <br>
                To stay our minds on and be staid <br>
                - By Robert Frost -
                <br>
                This was also said by Miss Liza to Angel to fix her mind on a star, to be strong and stand tall and do her best to unite her family and have hope that the future that awaits her will surely be what she had dreamed of.
                <br><br>

                The final example is when Verna and Bernie were in hospital because they met with an accident, Verna had herself confessed that - You always was better mom than me - ; - I thought you was the grownup, baby - and - Okay baby. You are the boss- . In fact, at the end of this touching novel, Angel stated – We need to stick together Bernie. We’re a family. -
                <br><br>

                To conclude, family is all about accepting differences as Verna accepts Angel embracing her grandmother and even raising Bernie.
